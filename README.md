## Background

ARMS is an examination arrangement system of Assumption University. It aims to improve the current system manual arrangement during the examination period for university students. As a result, it provides performance, efficiency, effectiveness, and minimum effort. As mentioned, it also removes the human error which might occur during the manual process. In most universities' rooms, buildings, papers, documents, and electricity are heavily consumed during the examination period. Without proper management and allocating these resources, it might further raise the unnecessary expense of the university.

ARMS is a kind of automated system, which can automatically perform an examination seating arrangement. It provides comprehensive features to instantly arrange all the eligible exam students to the specific seats into the examination rooms. Moreover, relevant insights and reports of how the system is arranged will also be provided. Furthermore, users can also modify and manually arrange some special courses at their fingertips. In conclusion, the ARMS system is almost a one-stop solution for examination seating management.
